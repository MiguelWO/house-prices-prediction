# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction repository! This project is designed to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of houses, we aim to build accurate predictive models to estimate house prices.

## Project Overview

The House Price Prediction project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather housing data from reliable sources or datasets. In this repository, you'll find a sample dataset `house_data.csv` containing various features of houses.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. The preprocessing steps are documented in the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the data through visualizations and statistical analysis. The EDA process is outlined in the `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features and transform existing ones to enhance model performance. Feature engineering techniques are showcased in the `feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook.

5. **Model Building:** Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms. The `model_building.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the training and evaluation of various models.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and techniques. Model evaluation results are discussed in the `model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

7. **Deployment (Optional):** If applicable, deploy the chosen model for real-time predictions. Deployment steps and code can be found in the `deployment` directory.

## Usage
