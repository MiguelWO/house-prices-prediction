# House Price Prediction Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for house price prediction models and datasets. It caters to data scientists, researchers, and developers interested in predicting housing prices using machine learning algorithms. The repository provides a collection of high-quality datasets, pre-processed and curated for accurate and reliable analysis.

## Key Features:

1.  Diverse Datasets: The repository includes a wide range of datasets from various geographical locations, covering different housing markets. These datasets encompass features such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical pricing data.

2.  Data Preprocessing: The repository offers preprocessed datasets, ensuring that they are cleansed, standardized, and ready for analysis. This saves time and effort for users, allowing them to focus on model development and evaluation.

3.  Benchmark Models: It provides a selection of benchmark models developed by experts in the field. These models are implemented using popular machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The benchmark models serve as baselines for comparison and performance evaluation.

4.  Model Evaluation Metrics: The repository offers a set of evaluation metrics commonly used in house price prediction tasks, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics enable users to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of their own models against the benchmarks.
